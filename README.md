# magnavox-odyssey
Implementation of Pong in Python, originally written as a final assignment for [_an introduction to interactive programming in Python_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1).

My intention is to re-write this in Python3 using the Pygame framework as an exercise and practice implementing OOP concepts and TDD approach.

## The original
My original implementation has two peculiarities. It is because of these that I have chosen to rewrite rather than refactor (also because it's only a hundred or so lines long anyway).
1. The original implementation utilises a custom Python gui module developed for the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1), which allows interactive Python programs to run and generate graphics in a web browser.
2. It is written in Python2. 

## Background to the name
From [_the Encyclopedia Britannica_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Magnavox-Company)
> The Magnavox Odyssey, known as the first console video game system, was released in 1972 and offered a game of table tennis, or Ping-Pong...In 1974 the makers of the Magnavox Odyssey sued Atari for stealing the concept for Pong. Magnavox won the lawsuit in 1977, upholding the companyâ€™s patent, but by then Atari had already licensed the patent for $700,000.
