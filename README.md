# magnavox-odyssey
Implementation of Pong in Python, originally written as a final assignment for [an introduction to interactive programming in Python] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1?).

Plan is to migrate the code to Python 3 and refactor as practice implementing OOP concepts and TDD.

Long term I would like to either expand this to include other games as programming practice and/or repurpose some of the code for my Pong clock.

## Background to the name
From [_the Encyclopedia Britannica_] (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Magnavox-Company)
> The Magnavox Odyssey, known as the first console video game system, was released in 1972 and offered a game of table tennis, or Ping-Pong...In 1974 the makers of the Magnavox Odyssey sued Atari for stealing the concept for Pong. Magnavox won the lawsuit in 1977, upholding the companyâ€™s patent, but by then Atari had already licensed the patent for $700,000.
